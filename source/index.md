Nova is an __easy-to-use__, __powerful__, and __flexible__ web-based content management system for managing and playing online text-based roleplaying games.

Unlike other content management systems that are more general in nature, Nova was designed from the ground up for these types of games/sites; everything you need is already built-in. If you do find there's something you need that isn't in Nova, you can either find it on [AnodyneXtras](http://xtras.anodyne-productions.com) or use Nova's developer features and write an extension to add it to Nova.

The underlying architecture of Nova is built using well established and _best-in-class_ technologies. Some of these key technologies include:

- [Laravel](http://laravel.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- [VueJS](http://vuejs.org)
