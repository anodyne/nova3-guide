## Tabs

Tabs are a simple way to reduce the visual clutter of a form by hiding sections and fields together out of sight until the user clicks on the tab they want. You can create as many tabs as you want. If you create so many tabs that they won't all fit on one line, the excess tabs will be collected into a simple dropdown menu at the end of the tab bar.

### Nested Tabs

New for Nova 3 is the ability to nest tabs inside of other tabs. This allows for more granular control over how your forms and information are presented. Nested tabs will take the form of "pills" instead of traditional tabs to differentiate them from the parent tab.

To create a tab inside another tab, simply select a parent tab when creating or editing a tab from Form Tab management.

## Sections

Sections are a way to put fields together into logical groupings. You can have as many sections as you want in your form.

### Unbound Sections

In previous versions of Nova, if your form had tabs, you could only have sections inside of tabs. In Nova NextGen, you can have unbound sections that aren't associated with a tab, even if they exist on the form. Unbound sections will always appear above any tabs and below any unbound fields.

To specify a section as being "unbound", simply set the Parent Tab option to "No parent tab".
