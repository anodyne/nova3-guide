## Recommended Tools

### Text Editors

Although you can get away with Notepad, Textedit, Vi, or whatever default text editor comes with your platform, we recommend using a good text editor with syntax highlighting to make things easier. Here are some recommended options:

1. [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - OS X/Windows/Linux - A commercial developer's editor, but well worth the price. Very powerful especially combined with plugins.
2. [Atom](http://atom.io/) - OS X/Windows/Linux - A new editor developed by Github. It's free and open source. It's similar to Sublime, but does not have the sheer depth of plugins available yet.
3. [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Windows - A free and very popular developer's editor for Windows.
4. [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html) - OS X/Windows/Linux - A free, open source text editor geared towards programmers and web developers.
5. [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/) - OS X - A commercial editor with significant polish and features beyond just a text editor.

### FTP Clients

Although there are many ways to deploy Nova, the simplest is to simply copy your local site to your hosting provider. The easiest way to accomplish this is with an FTP Client. There are many available, but some recommended ones include:

1. [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) - OS X - The de facto FTP/SFTP client on OS X. Easy to use, fast, folder-syncing and pretty much anything else you could ask for.
2. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) - OS X/Windows/Linux - Probably the best option for Windows and Linux users. Free and very powerful (but very ugly on the Mac!).
3. [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/) - OS X/Windows - A decent free option for both OS X and Windows users. Not as full featured as the others.
4. [ForkLift](http://www.binarynights.com/forklift/) - OS X - A solid alternative to Transmit, and slightly cheaper to boot.
