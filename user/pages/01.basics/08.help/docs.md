Although we have done our best to document as much as possible here in the documentation, it's inevitable that there will be questions we haven't answered. We want to be as accessible as possible, so we have several methods to reach us in order to get help directly:

## Forum

Our [forum](http://forums.anodyne-productions.com) is the first place to look for previously answered questions and to get your questions answered quickly. Posts are usually answered within 24 hours, most often far less than that.

## Twitter

We highly recommend you [follow us](http://twitter.com/anodyneprod) on Twitter as that provides a real-time way for us to reach out to our followers and let them know about news and events related to Nova development.

## IRC

If IRC is more your speed, we have a [chat room](https://kiwiirc.com/client?settings=3cca542b4ff586e92846490eea2d3277) on AceIRC. If you prefer to use your own client you can connect to irc.aceirc.org using port 6667 and join #Anodyne.

## GitHub Issues

If you have an issue, a general question, or even if you want to contribute to any of our projects, you can use the issue trackers on any of our [projects](http://github.com/anodyne). We're very diligent about responding to issues posted there and it can provide a useful way to start a conversation with us.
